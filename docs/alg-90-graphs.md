## Which is better BFS or DFS?
It really depends on the problem you want to solve.

Breadth First (Nearest Neighbour) | Depth First (Faraway)
--- | ---
Think wide| Think deep
Use Queue| Use Stack
Better near top| Going deep to inspect each possibility
Social Networks (FB, LinkedIn)| Game simulations (Like chess game) to predict
Nearby peers (Games/ Torrents)|
