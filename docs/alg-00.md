## Properties of a sorting algorithm

### Is it stable?
Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e. values). 
That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same 
key and with R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.

### Does it take an extra space (Space Complexity)?
Does sorting takes in-place (i.e. sorts the array itself) or creates new data structures etc?

### How many comparisons or swaps are performed (Time Complexity)?
How many iterations are needed and whats the time complexity?

### Is it adaptive?
DOes it changes is complexity in certain circumstances? If is sorted, if it's nearly sorted, if it's reversed etc.
